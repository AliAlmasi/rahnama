<h3>Simple guide to make your personal v2ray server</h3>
<h4>based on my personal server configurations</h4>
</div>
<h2>What's This?</h2>
<p>Recently, people's access to the Internet has been disrupted by the government, and many daily Internet tools such as Instagram and WhatsApp have been cut off.</p>
<p>This guide will help you to make a personal vless/trojan server using a popular xray web-panel called <code>x-ui</code>.</p>
<p>Every step on this guide has been checked and the results have been monitorred by myself with my personal server. Don't worry, I will also tell you what kind of server you need to buy and where you should buy it from =D.</p>
<h2>What kinda server should I buy?</h2>
<p>If you have access to payment methods <b>outside Iran</b>, then I recommend you to buy a CX21 (or CPX21) cloud server from <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud#:~:text=5.18%20/%20mo-,CX21,-vCPU">Hetzner</a></p>
<p>Else, you can buy <b>Ubuntu-based</b> servers from <b>Any VPS provider inside Iran</b>.</p>
<p>The location of the servers should be in European countries (especially Germany and the Netherlands) to have the best speed and less delay to send information to Iran (to you).</p>
